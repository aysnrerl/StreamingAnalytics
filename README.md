# ⚡ SQL Performance Strategy

The application is optimized to handle datasets containing **more than one million records** while maintaining responsive performance.

## Optimization Techniques

* **Dapper Micro ORM:** Direct SQL compilation bypasses EF Core's heavy translation layer.
* **Parameterized SQL Queries:** Prevents SQL injection and benefits from SQL Server's query plan caching.
* **Server-side Pagination:** Avoids loading large datasets into RAM by utilizing SQL `OFFSET-FETCH`.
* **Covering Indexes:** Resolves analytical queries directly from index trees without hitting the base table.
* **Index Seek Operations:** Avoids full table scans, reducing logical page reads.
* **DTO-based Data Transfer:** Limits RAM overhead by mapping only the required fields.

---

# 🚀 Performance Advantages

* **Lightning-Fast Queries:** Dashboard metrics compute in < 15ms.
* **Minimal Memory Consumption:** Light backend foot-print (< 90MB RAM under load).
* **High Responsiveness:** Instant table filtering on 1M rows.
* **Scalable Codebase:** Modular MVC structure allows adding indexes or caching seamlessly.

---

# 🗄 Database Design

StreamPulse is built around a centralized streaming activity table called **StreamingLogs**. The table is designed to support analytical queries, dashboard metrics, reporting operations, and high-performance filtering.

## Entity Structure

| Column | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LogId** | **INT (PK, Identity)** | Primary Key |
| **UserName** | **NVARCHAR(100)** | Viewer username |
| **ContentTitle** | **NVARCHAR(250)** | Movie or TV show title |
| **Genre** | **NVARCHAR(50)** | Content category |
| **Platform** | **NVARCHAR(50)** | Streaming provider |
| **WatchDate** | **DATETIME** | Watch timestamp |
| **WatchDurationMin** | **INT** | Duration in minutes |
| **Rating** | **DECIMAL(3,1)** | User rating (1-10) |
| **Country** | **NVARCHAR(100)** | Viewer country |
| **DeviceType** | **NVARCHAR(50)** | Device used |
| **Status** | **NVARCHAR(50)** | Watch status (Completed, Dropped, etc.) |

---

## ⚡ Database Index Optimization

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_StreamingLogs_Filters
ON StreamingLogs
(
    Platform,
    Genre,
    Status
)
INCLUDE
(
    UserName,
    ContentTitle,
    WatchDate,
    WatchDurationMin,
    Rating,
    Country,
    DeviceType
);
```

# ⚙ Dependency Injection

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<DapperContext>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<StreamingService>();
```

---

# 🔐 Security Considerations

The application uses parameterized SQL queries to protect against SQL Injection attacks.

```csharp
var query = @"
SELECT *
FROM StreamingLogs
WHERE UserName LIKE @UserName";

var data = await connection.QueryAsync<StreamingLogDto>(
    query,
    new { UserName = "%" + search + "%" }
);
```

---
